# Systematic-Multi-Factor-Credit-Alpha-Strategy
This project implements an institutional-grade "Alpha-Plus" systematic credit strategy benchmarked against the LQD. It treats portfolio construction as a Constrained Convex Optimization problem. It isolates idiosyncratic alpha using ML and maximizes risk-adjusted returns while strictly adhering to DTS Neutrality and Key Rate Duration constraints.
